======
  
## What is new on 0.80
   
* Because of many changes version number has been rised signifally.
* This version gives netform support for Portlet  based programming. 
** In Netform Portlet is reusable component which can be attached to web page.
** NetForm application start to support NetForm portlets.
*** Portlets is part of web page which lives it own life and it is not attached to just one but many pages.
*** NetForm portlet is not same as java portlet api. (Note NetForm Portlet API is not very tested yet)
* New reflection based programming, possibly to bind components directly to POJO.
** Related Classes:
** ReflectionData
** ReflectionValidate
** ObjectCollectionTableModel
** If Pojo's set method is throwing exception then binded component is considered as not valid.
      
* Session out of sync is now possible to capture on JSP level, by using form.isSessionOutOfSync() method.
* JSP Tag lib
** JSP 2.0 support
* Table changes
** Table related components (AddRowButton, InsertRowButtonand DeleteRowButton )
*** TableModelListener
* MultiForm support 
** Form.allowChange not suppported and removed
** Fixes
*** TextField.validate() and all related 
   
## What is new on 0.64

* New Components
** PasswordField
** CheckBox field
* TimestampField was empty and null was not allowed. It was valid. This was found also on all number fields
* Button can be attached to Table row, and events from Table components are catchable.
* Table
** component events are catchable.
** Bug on Table, It caused error on Table.synchRowNumbers() on sertain cases. It is now fixed
** 937703 Bug on Table.getText() doesn't format correctly fixed
** JSP inteface Table.getBoolean(..), see JavaDoc
** Table Validation is working, still needs little bit optimization
* ListTableModel, didn't update table when using setList()
** When updating List won't cause out of sync situation
* SimpleTableModel.resetAll(Object[]) -> setObjects()
* SimpleTableModel.reset() new method makes SimpleTableModel empty
* New Method DataSetTableModel.setDataSet()
* More methods for Timestamp
** To get dates
** To get value by specific format
* Form.getPostAction(), to be used instead of getRequestURI() <form method="POST" action="<%=form.getPostAction() %>">
* Timestamp field can be splitted to Date and Time part on JSP page

 ## What is new on 0.63
* Form.execute() optimazation caused Form.startService() was called only once.
* BugFix on example app on table2.jsp/Table2Form.java
* Form new methods getContextPath(), Form.getRequestURI() which also effects how to make JSP <form method="POST" action="<%=form.getRequestURI() %>">
* Fix on Table.insertRowBeforeFirstSelection()
* Fixes on table
* Components
** New Components FloatField, DoubleField
* New validation system
** New Validate transfer class
** When child is not valid then parent is not valid either.
* ListModel, this is abstract class to model Lists. Can be used with J2EE applications. I'm using it with JBoss.
* Package structure has changed. If you are using Eclipse. CTRL-SHIFT-O helps, remember also your JSP pages
* New column format system.
** Components can read their format from parent. example in table level is possible set column formats or it can read global
** Future default formats can be set on web.xml
     
## What is new on 0.62
* Table can be used inside Table as Component
** This is exiting feature. See the example table2.jsp
* Bug fixes on Table
* TableModel can be connected to multible tables.
* HTML escape improvements
* SimpleTableModel.add() adds row to last as it should
   
   
## What is new on 0.61
* Table programming interface is changed (easier, better)
* DisplayRow (removed) class removed
* TableModelComponent removed
* Functionality is made through DataComponent
* API Change Table.setTableModelComponent -> Table.setModelComponent
* Component's are based on new ComponentData data handling.
** It is optional
** It is done because Table. Every component now has option to store and retrieve data through ComponentData
* Stared to developing STATE machine to control usage of methods.
* This methods that some functionality is generating Exception when called on wrong state. Some methods are designed to work only example on templating side. So mechanism is needed to prevent programmers to use methods on wrong place.
* Component is isValid by default.
* Removed components
** NumberField, Replaced bye IntegerField etc.
** ToggleField, to be replace by BooleanField
* New Components, IntegerField, LongField
* HTML escape implemented
